# Sensing-I2C

Hardware:
- Nordic nRF52840 Development Kit
- MMA8452Q, 3-axis, 12-bit/8-bit digital accelerometer


Measuring the acceleration in all three axes (X,Y,Z) every 0.5 s using I2C Communication. 
In addition, the current orientation of the board is to be determined and output. Differentiating between 6
different states, depending on which axis is pointing up or down (i.e., X UP, X DOWN, Y UP, Y DOWN, Z UP, and Z DOWN)
